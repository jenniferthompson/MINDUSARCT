The MIND-USA clinical trial aims to define the role of antipsychotics in the management of delirium in critically ill patients, specifically comparing haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) and ziprasidone (atypical antipsychotic) to placebo. Further details can be found in both the trial listing on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01211522) and on
the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/mq38r/), which houses:

# Screening, Consent, and Randomization{#screening}

<hr>

Because this trial aims to describe the association between antipsychotics and treatment of delirium (rather than prevention), patients were required to be delirious prior to being randomized to study drug. In order to treat delirium immediately once observed, however, patients (or their surrogates) were
consented as soon as they met study inclusion criteria and were found not to meet exclusion criteria.

Upon consent, patients could be randomized any time in the following five days, provided: no exclusions were met within that time; the patient remained in the ICU; and they did eventually become delirious. Patients are considered "disqualified" if they left the ICU or the study (via discharge, death, or withdrawal) prior to experiencing delirium, or never experienced delirium in the five days following consent.

## Overview of Screening, Exclusions and Randomization

`r table_nums("screening", display = "cite")` presents patient flow information for the `r format_comma(sum_na(ptstatus_df$screened))` patients who were screened with 72 hours of meeting inclusion criteria. Screening took place between `r first_month` and `r last_month`.

#### Note on Intent To Treat Population

When the treatment blind was broken, we found that `r with(ptstatus_df, sum(rand_list & !randomized))` patients who never met criteria for randomization
were assigned a treatment group by the investigational pharmacy, unbeknownst to study and/or treatment teams, who considered the patients disqualified for
appropriate reasons documented in the database. This assignment was done in the
pharmacy only, with no study drug ever sent, no intervention done, and no
outcomes tracked for these patients. Because these patients never met
randomization criteria, they were never considered to be randomized or treated by site coordinators; as disqualified patients, they had no outcomes data tracked after the date of disqualification, and no study drug was given. They are included in the "Ineligible for Randomization" group below and are *not*
included in the intent-to-treat population.

The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(randomized & !ever_studydrug))` patients who were randomized but never received a dose of study drug *are* included in the ITT population.

```{r print_screen_table}

  kable(format = "html", col.names = c("", "N (%)"), align = c("l", "r")) %>%
  mykablestyle %>%
  group_rows("Screened Patients", 2, 3) %>%
  group_rows("Approached Patients", 4, 5) %>%
  group_rows("Consented Patients", 6, 8) %>%
  group_rows("Reasons for Ineligibility", 9, 11) %>%
  group_rows("Organ Failures Present at Randomization", 12, 14) %>%

  footnote(
    general = "Patients could have none, one, or two of the listed organ failures present at randomization; percentages may not add up to 100%."
  )

```

## Study Exclusions

```{r prep_exclusions}
## Some exclusions aren't relevant for our purposes here:
## - Rapidly resolving organ failure, 72h eligibility period exceeded:
##     indicates patient did not meet screening criteria
## - Patient/surrogate refusal: not considered a study exclusion
## We're also interested in the *combined* version of some:
## - pregnancy + breast feeding (2a, 2b); look at exc_2 instead
## - all exclusions relating to time running out (9c, e, f); look at exc_9cef

    )
  ) %>%

  sprintf("After Consent\\\n(N = %s)", format_comma(sum_na(ptstatus_df$excluded_later)))
)

```

The vast majority of exclusions were found at the time of screening. Some
patients were excluded after consent, if determined to have cognitive disability
(indicated by an IQCODE score >= 4.5) or were discovered to have an exclusion criteria prior to randomization. For the `r format_comma(sum_na(ptstatus_df$excluded_ever))`
patients excluded from MINDUSA, `r table_nums("exclusions", display = "cite")`
presents exclusions:

1. At any point (column 1; % out of *all* exclusions)
1. At the time of screening (column 2; % out of all *screening* exclusions)
1. After consent (column 3; % out of all *post-consent* exclusions)

Patients could meet multiple exclusion criteria; therefore, column percentages may total more than 100%.

# Descriptions of the Cohorts

<hr>

Due to our study design (described briefly in the previous section), a
substantial number of patients gave consent to be in the study, but were unable to be randomized to treatment. Thus, we first describe demographics and ICU
admission characteristics of all consented patients, comparing those randomized to those not randomized (`r table_nums("baseline_all", display = "cite")`). We
then describe those characteristics, as well as the course of hospitalization, by treatment group among randomized patients only (`r table_nums("baseline_trt", display = "cite")` and `r table_nums("inhosp_trt", display = "cite")`).

## Notes on Baseline Tables

**Medical vs Surgical Patients**: In both baseline tables, "surgical patients"
met one or more of the following criteria:

1. Recorded primary ICU admission reason involving "surgery"
2. Emergency or elective surgery between hospital admission and ICU admission
3. Went to the OR between ICU admission and study enrollment

**AUDIT Questionnaire**: This questionnaire was developed to be administered
directly to the patient; out of necessity, we often administered it to
surrogates, leading to missing data if a surrogate was unsure about the answer to a particular question. We have therefore calculated the score in two different ways: 1) if any question is missing, the total is missing; and 2) any missing questions are assumed to have a score of 0.

## Randomized vs Non-Randomized Patients

No information after study disqualification was collected on patients who were
not randomized; therefore, we can only describe demographic and ICU admission
characteristics of these patients. `r table_nums("baseline_all", display = "cite")` describes these characteristics for both all consented patients, and separately for patients who were and were not able to be randomized.

## Randomized Patients by Treatment Group

The following tables describe demographic and ICU admission characteristics (`r table_nums("baseline_trt", display = "cite")`) and in-hospital characteristics (`r table_nums("inhosp_trt", display = "cite")`) of all randomized patients.

### Demographic & ICU Admission Characteristics, All **Randomized** Patients

```{r baseline_trt}
my_html(
  summaryM(as.formula(paste(admit_formula_lhs, "trt", sep = " ~ ")),
           data = subset(ptsummary_all_df2, randomized)),
  caption = "Demographic & ICU Admission Characteristics of Randomized Patients"
)

```

### Descriptions of "Other" ICU Admission Reasons

To save space, reasons for "other" ICU admission among randomized patients are collapsed.

<details>
<summary>"Other" Reasons for ICU Admission</summary>
```{r icursn_other_table}
ptsummary_all_df %>%
  filter(randomized & icu_rsn == "Other") %>%
  dplyr::select(icu_rsn_other) %>%

    format = "html",
    col.names = c("Explanation for 'other' ICU admission reason"),
    align = c("l")
  ) %>%
  mykablestyle

```

</details>

### Intervention Period Characteristics by Treatment Group

Unless otherwise specified, quantities in this table reflect the **14 days including and following randomization** (the “study period”). Additional notes:

- "Liberation from mechanical ventilation" variables apply only to patients who
were on either type of MV when randomized, or were placed on MV within the 24
hours following randomization.
- "Successful" ICU and hospital discharge indicates discharge followed by at
least 48 hours alive.
- All time-to-event descriptions (eg, ICU length of stay) begin at the time of
randomization and go through the entire hospitalization (even if the patient
remained hospitalized after the intervention period).
- "Antipsychotics" refers not only to open-label haloperidol and ziprasidone,
but *any* antipsychotic, including quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and
risperidone. Doses are converted to haloperidol equivalents.
- "Benzodiazepines" includes midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam, all converted
to midazolam equivalents.
- "Opioids" includes fentanyl, remifentanil, morphine, and hydromorphone, all
converted to fentanyl equivalents.

All drug conversion formulas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZGfxAmTFxGgfzjwE0trrpKEn_21QDwCSGJIv-E5kiE4/edit?usp=drivesdk).

# Description of the Intervention

<hr>

Once randomized, patients could receive study drug for treatment of delirium for up to 14 days, up to twice per day (with a third dose in rare cases). Study drug could be held temporarily, either for delirium resolution or for other reasons, or permanently discontinued. `r table_nums("intervention_pt", display = "cite")` describes randomization, receipt of study drug, reasons for study drug hold or discontinuation, and status at the end of hospitalization for each of the three treatment groups. `r table_nums("intervention_dose", display = "cite")` describes all opportunities to receive study drug dose.

In both tables, quantities are represented as either `N (%)` or as `median [25th, 75th percentiles]`, followed by `mean +/- standard deviation`.

**Note** that temporary holds and permanent discontinuations listed below only include drug stopped for adverse clinical reasons; they do *not* include instances where study drug was not administered due to resolution of delirium or patient unavailability (including ICU discharge, death, study withdrawal, being off the floor, or being placed on comfort care measures/hospice).

## Intervention by Patient

Patients were approximately equally randomized to the three treatment groups, with each group receiving study drug approximately the same number of days and times.

`r round(mean(ptsummary_df$ever_drug_held)*100)`% of randomized patients ever had study drug temporarily held, most commonly due to oversedation. There is a
somewhat higher proportion of patients in the ziprasidone group who *ever* had
study drug held, although the total number of doses of study drug given are
similar between groups. Compared to the placebo and haloperidol groups, about 5%
more patients randomized to ziprasidone ever had drug held due to prolonged QTc,
and about 6% more had drug held at some point due to medical team refusal.

`r round(mean(ptsummary_df$ever_drug_permdc_active)*100)`% of randomized
patients had the intervention permanently discontinued while actively receiving
study drug *(i.e., permanent discontinuation occurred at a scheduled dose
immediately following a dose given, rather than temporarily held)*. This was
most commonly due to refusal of either the medical team or the patient/family.

dose_attempts <- doses_df %>%
  ## Restrict to randomized patients and add treatment group
  right_join(rand_df, by = "id") %>%
  ## Only keep doses either given, or held due to adverse clinical reasons
  ## (excludes doses held due to patient unavailability), or permanently d/c'ed
  ## while actively receiving study drug
  filter(drug_given | drug_held | drug_permdc_active)

```

`r table_nums("intervention_dose", display = "cite")` describes the `r format(nrow(dose_attempts), big.mark = ",")` doses of study drug attempted
during the course of the study - generally, two doses per day that the patient
remained alive and in the ICU. This includes:

1. Doses **given**
1. Doses **temporarily held** for adverse clinical reasons
1. Doses **permanently discontinued** for adverse clinical reasons while the
patient was actively receiving study drug
    (ie: A patient who was actively receiving drug until discontinuation due to suspected NMS would be counted below; a patient who had had drug held for two days due to oversedation, then had study drug permanently discontinued by request of their family, would not be included)

We do not include below instances where study drug was not administered due to
resolution of delirium or patient unavailability (including ICU discharge,
death, study withdrawal, being off the floor, or being placed on comfort care
measures/hospice).

Nearly all randomized patients received at least one dose of study drug. Two patients had study drug held due to either oversedation or prolonged QTc during
their remaining ICU stay, and never received a dose of study drug.

About 75% of doses were successfully given in each of the three treatment groups. Pre-dose QTcs were also roughly equivalent between the three groups.

Oversedation was the most common reason for temporary hold by far, followed
distantly by medical team refusal and prolonged QTc. Temporary study drug hold
due to other safety concerns (adverse events, dystonia, EPS) was rare.

## "Other" Reasons for Hold & Discontinuation

Explanations for study drug held (`r table_nums("dose_held_other", display = "cite")`) and discontinued (`r table_nums("dose_permdc_other", display = "cite")`) for "other" reasons are listed in the tables below. (To save space, these tables are collapsed. These explanations are taken directly from our database; potentially identifiable information, including dates, times and
parenthetical details, have been redacted to preserve patient privacy.)

```{r prep_dose_other}
other_held_table <- doses_df %>%
  filter(held_other) %>%
  dplyr::select(held_other_exp)

other_permdc_table <- doses_df %>%

## Holds/Discontinuations due to Adverse Events

As noted above, during the intervention, `r sum(doses_df$held_ae)` study drug
doses were documented as temporarily held due to an adverse event, and `r sum(doses_df$permdc_active_ae)` doses were documented as permanently
discontinued due to an adverse event. The following table describes these `r sum(doses_df$held_ae) + sum(doses_df$permdc_active_ae)` scenarios, as manually
investigated by our clinical staff. Potentially identifiable information is not included.

The final column indicates whether the adverse event documentation reflects any
potential data entry issues. Our database was locked prior to breaking the treatment blind; therefore, any errors discovered after that point have not been
corrected in the original data.

```{r ae_descrips}
drug_aes %>%
  mutate(
    ## Make a single column for whether hold or discontinuation
    hold_dc = ifelse(
      ever_held_ae, "Temporary Hold", "Permanent Discontinuation"
    ),
    ## Indicate whether this is a likely data entry issue - we locked the
    ## in-hospital database prior to breaking treatment blind, so these are not
    ## corrected
    data_issue = factor(
      as.numeric(stringr::str_detect(comments, "error")),
      levels = 0:1, labels = c("No", "Yes")
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(hold_dc, descrip_source, description, data_issue) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    colnames = c(
      "Hold/Discontinuation", "Documentation Source", "Description of Event",
      "Potential Data Issue?"
    ),
    filter = "top",
    options = list(
      pageLength = 5,
      lengthMenu = c(2, seq(5, nrow(drug_aes), 5))
    )
  )

```

## Protocol Noncompliance

We summarize below any protocol noncompliance that increased safety risk to the patient, broken down according to a simple categorization scheme followed prospectively during the conduct of the MIND-USA investigation. During the entire study, there were `r nrow(noncompliance_df)` events which met these criteria, among `r length(unique(noncompliance_df$id))` unique patients. Nearly all events were lack of completion/documentation of study assessments, study
drug titration which did not follow the protocol, or "other." Study drug
titration noncompliance happened most frequently in the haloperidol and
ziprasidone groups; study assessment noncompliance happened most frequently in
the placebo group.

```{r noncompliance}
## -- Summarize protocol noncompliance: N (%) in each category -----------------
## Variables indicating categories for noncompliance

# Safety Outcomes and ABCDE Bundle Compliance

Our three primary safety outcomes are neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS); Torsades de pointes (Torsades); and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Incidence of each was minimal and is detailed below.

We also collected data on daily performance of some elements of the [ABCDEF Bundle](http://www.iculiberation.org/Bundles/Pages/default.aspx); we describe
compliance with these elements on a daily basis, both for all patient-days and
for randomized patients during the intervention.

### NMS

All suspected cases of NMS (i.e., patients in whom there was an initial suspicion of possible NMS) were rapidly reported to the DSMB for evaluation and
the final determination of existence. No randomized patients ever experienced
*confirmed* NMS during the study (during or outside the intervention phase).

```{r nms}
## How many patients experienced NMS at all? during intervention?
n_rand_nms_ih <- sum_na(ptsummary_df$ever_nms_ih)
n_rand_nms_int <- sum_na(ptsummary_df$ever_nms_int)

## In an ideal, reproducible world, we'd code text to account for all plausible
## scenarios, but we have a deadline and both the above are zero so we're just
## going to go with that because that data will not change at this point.

```

### Torsades de Pointes

During the intervention phase, `r sum_na(ptsummary_df$ever_torsades_any_int)` randomized patients experienced confirmed Torsades de pointes. Both instances
were rapidly reported to the DSMB as "Torsades, clinical outcome"; descriptions
of both events are included below, with potentially identifying details
redacted. While both events were within the study drug period, neither patient
was on study drug at the time of the event, and neither event was considered to be related to study drug.

```{r torsades}
torsades_df %>%
  dplyr::select(-id, -ae_serious) %>% ## Torsades always serious, redundant
  kable(
    format = "html",
    col.names = c("Trt", "Study Phase", "Description")
  ) %>%
  mykablestyle()

```

### EPS

To describe and determine the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), we used a modified version of the [Simpson-Angus Score](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1970.tb02066.x/epdf) which included elbow and wrist rigidity, glabellar tap, resting tremor, and salivation. Study drug was held if at least three out of these five symptoms had a score of 3 or higher on a given day; patients whose glabellar tap reflex could not be assessed were assigned a symptom score of 0. (Study drug was restarted if EPS resolved to a score of <3 on all categories.) Details for the `r sum_na(ptsummary_df$ever_eps_int)` randomized patients who met this criteria at least once during the intervention period are shown below.

```{r eps}
ptsummary_df %>%
  filter(ever_eps_int) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    trt, days_eps_int, eps_score_mean_exp_int, ever_held_eps, times_held_eps
  ) %>%
  kable(
    format = "html",
    col.names = c(
      "Trt", "Days met EPS criteria", "Overall EPS Score when Criteria Met",
      "Study drug held for EPS?", "Doses held for EPS"
    )
  ) %>%
  mykablestyle()

```

### ABCDE Compliance

We collected data on the following elements related to the [ABCDEF Bundle](http://www.iculiberation.org/Bundles/Pages/default.aspx), using the earlier definitions of "compliance" in place when study enrollment began. **In
order to be eligible for any of these on a given day, the patient had to have
been in the ICU all 24 hours.**

- *Awakening* (SAT)
    - Eligible if: On invasive mechanical ventilation, and not off unit when
    staff attempted SAT
    - Compliant if: Received an SAT, or did not receive an SAT for a reason
    besides "other"
- *Breathing* (SBT)
    - Eligible if: On invasive mechanical ventilation, and not off unit when
    staff attempted SBT
    - Compliant if: Received an SBT, or did not receive an SBT for a reason
    besides "other"
- *Coordination* (Coordination of SAT and SBT)
    - Eligible if: On invasive MV and received both an SAT and SBT
    - Compliant if: Patient was off sedation when SBT was performed
- Nonpharmacological interventions for *delirium*
    - Eligible if: Not comatose
    - Compliant if: Received >=1 nonpharmacological intervention (pain
    assessment/management, orientation, sensory, sleep)
- *Early mobility/exercise*
    - Eligible if: Not off floor when staff attempted therapy
    - Compliant if: Was screened for safety, and either:
        - Failed safety screen for a recorded reason (MI, arrhythmia, FiO2,
        PEEP, or vasopressors)
        - Passed safety screen, but did not receive mobility due to
        sedatives/analgesics or refusal of patient, family, or clinical team
        - Received mobility

IQCODE and level of arousal at randomization are the only covariates with missing data; the amount is still quite minimal (<2% for each), and these
variables are not missing in ways that appear to be related. In the plot below, red indicates missingness and blue indicates a present value. Cases which have both variables missing would be in red in the lower lefthand corner.

```{r iqcode_rass_miss}

```

To make sure none of our covariates completely explain any of the others
(resulting in collinearity), we perform a redundancy analysis, detailed below.
No covariates suggest evidence of too-high collinearity.

# Statistical Methods{#methods}

<hr>

Our full, prespecified Statistical Analysis Plan includes more detailed information on database management, data cleaning, study methods, and guiding statistical principles. The version in place prior to breaking the treatment
blind is registered on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/xps5h/). Any
further updates to the SAP, in addition to other study documents and R code for
analysis, will be available via the project's [primary OSF project page](https://osf.io/mq38r/).

## Unadjusted Analysis{#unadjusted}

### In-Hospital Continuous Outcomes

We analyze continuous outcomes (delirium/coma-free days, delirium duration, and
coma duration) using the Kruskal-Wallis test. These outcomes are not normally
distributed (see each section for further details); therefore, the assumptions
for a parametric ANOVA would be violated, and results would be unreliable. The
nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test does not assume that the outcome has a
specific distribution, and thus provides more power and reliability in the case
of a non-normal distribution.

### Time to Event Outcomes

We describe and test for differences in time to death using Kaplan-Meier curves
and the log-rank test, respectively.

Our other time-to-event outcomes (ICU and hospital discharge, liberation from
mechanical ventilation, and ICU readmission), have a competing risk of death,
with an additional competing risk of hospital discharge for the latter two. This means that patients who experience death (or discharge) do not have the
opportunity to experience the outcome of interest. Traditional survival analysis
assumes that that the reason for censoring is independent of the outcome; here,
that is not the case. Kaplan-Meier curves would be misleading in these
scenarios, because they do not take these "competing risks" into account.
Therefore, we describe together the cumulative incidences of both the outcome of
interest and death (and discharge, if applicable), along with score tests for
the difference between groups in the subdistribution of interest.

Generally, the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(studywd_ih == "Yes" & hospdis_noinfo))`
patients who withdrew in the hospital with no discharge or death information
available are censored at the time of withdrawal; we censor at `x.01` days
anyone who has experienced neither outcome of interest nor the competing risks
by `x` days, where `x` is the time frame for the specified outcome. More details
on censoring are provided with each analysis.

## Adjusted Analysis{#adjusted}

### Multivariable Modeling

We perform multivariable regression analyses to explore the association between
treatment group and our outcome variables while adjusting for potential baseline
confounders. Though these covariates should be balanced between treatment groups
thanks to randomization, adjustment increases our power and precision. We
performed a redundancy analysis[^rms] to ensure that no covariates completely
explain any of the others (resulting in collinearity); see [above](#exploration). No covariates suggest evidence of too-high collinearity.

[^rms]: Harrell, Frank E. (2015) *Regression Modeling Strategies.* New York, NY: Springer.

In addition, we adjust all coefficient variances using Huber-White sandwich
estimation, clustered by study site. This will help account for unmeasured
variability and correlation among patients within a given site.

### In-Hospital Continuous Outcomes

We use proportional odds logistic regression for continuous outcomes
(delirium/coma-free days, delirium duration, and coma duration); this method
assumes an ordinal outcome but does not assume that it follows a specific
statistical distribution.

### Time to Event Outcomes

We use Cox proportional hazards regression for mortality. For all other time to
event outcomes (ICU and hospital discharge and liberation from mechanical
ventilation), we use competing risks regression[^fg], treating death as our
competing risk. Generally, the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(studywd_ih == "Yes" & hospdis_noinfo))` patients who withdrew in the hospital with no discharge or
death information available are censored at the time of withdrawal; we censor at
`x.01` days anyone who has experienced neither death nor the outcome of interest
by `x` days, where `x` is the time frame in question (30 days for liberation
from mechanical ventilation; 90 days for ICU and hospital discharge and ICU
readmission; both time points for mortality). More details on censoring are
provided with each analysis.

[^fg]: Fine, J., & Gray, R. (1999). A Proportional Hazards Model for the Subdistribution of a Competing Risk. *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 94(446), 496-509. doi:10.2307/2670170

### Model Assumptions{#assumptions}

We check proportional odds and proportional hazards assumptions graphically for
each model. When checking the proportional odds assumption, something may be
amiss if Y axis values (estimated coefficient at various cutoffs of our outcome)
change substantially across the X axis, particularly if the effect changes
direction (noted by the dotted line at 0). For further discussion, please see
Harrell's *Regression Modeling Strategies*, section 13.3.[^rms]

For the proportional hazard assumption, we are looking for fairly flat
associations between beta coefficients (Y axis) and time (X axis), which would
indicate that the hazard remains constant over time.

### Covariates{#covariates}

All multivariable models are adjusted for the following baseline covariates, in
addition to treatment group:

- Age at study consent
- Preexisting CI, via the IQCODE (performed via patient or surrogate questionnaire)
- Preexisting frailty, via the CSHA Clinical Frailty Score
- Preexisting comorbidities, via the Charlson Comorbidities Index
- SOFA on the day of randomization, excluding the CNS component
- Level of arousal at randomization, via the RASS closest to the time of randomization. Categorized as:
    - Deeply sedated (RASS -3)
    - Lightly sedated (RASS -2 or -1)
    - Normal (RASS 0)
    - Agitated (RASS > 0)

Age, CFS, Charlson, and modified SOFA at randomization are all allowed to have a
nonlinear relationship with our outcome, using restricted cubic splines with `r rcsknots` knots. The distribution of IQCODE `r spark_iqcode` (`r rndformat(mean_na(model_df$iqcode_total_ph == 3) * 100, 0)`% of patients had a score of exactly 3) has too little variability to allow this flexibility. (Level
of arousal and treatment are both categorical covariates, and thus nonlinearity
does not apply.)

## Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect

We are interested in whether any association between treatment group and our
main outcomes is modified by several factors. In secondary analyses, we will include interaction (or cross-product) terms in our multivariable models between
treatment and the following variables:

- Age at consent
- Severity of illness, measured by modified SOFA on the day of randomization
- Pre-existing cognitive impairment, measured by IQCODE at consent
- Sepsis at randomization, as defined by primary reason for ICU admission
- Medical vs surgical patient, as defined by meeting at least one of the
following criteria:
    - Recorded primary ICU admission reason involving "surgery"
    - Emergency or elective surgery between hospital admission and ICU admission
    - Went to the OR between ICU admission and study enrollment

## Missing Data

We have very little missing covariate or outcome data (see [above](#exploration)
for further details); therefore, we use complete case analysis for all
in-hospital outcomes. From models which would include all `r n_rand` randomized patients (all except liberation from mechanical ventilation and ICU
readmission), complete case analysis excludes `r pts_missany %>% pull(nmiss)` (`r rndformat(pts_missany %>% pull(pctmiss), 0)`%).

We do use single imputation for missing mental status on a daily basis, to
reduce potential bias from the `r round(mean(is.na(subset(daily_int_df, study_status == "Intervention")$mental_status_raw)) * 100)`% of patient-days during the intervention period without sufficient RASS and/or CAM information to
determine mental status. Please see [Notes on Variable Calculation](#dcfds) for
further rationale and details.

## Software Summary

We used `r R.version$version.string` for all analyses and data management. Full
package details can be found [below](#software); specific packages used for major components include:

```{r main_pkgs}
## Join table indicating purposes for major packages we want to highlight
pkg_uses <- tribble(
  ~ package, ~ reason,
  # "naniar",    "Missing data exploration",
  "cmprsk",    "Competing risks survival analysis",
  "survival",  "General survival analysis",
  "survminer", "Presentation of survival data",
  "rms",       "Multivariable regression"
)

devtools::session_info()$packages %>%
  filter(package %in% pkg_uses$package) %>%
  left_join(pkg_uses, by = "package") %>%
  dplyr::select(package, version, date, source, reason) %>%
  kable(
    format = "html",
    col.names = c("Package", "Version", "Updated", "Source", "Used for"),
    align = c("l", "r", "r", "c")
  ) %>%
  mykablestyle()

```

We also used R for all data management. Links to all R code for both data
management and this analysis can be found on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/mq38r/).

In addition, we use the [`checkpoint`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkpoint) package for
**reproducibility**. This package downloaded R package versions on CRAN as of
May 14, 2018, and will use these versions going forward, regardless of future
software updates. (The `ggthemr` and `JTHelpers` packages, solely housed on
Github, were also installed in this directory on the same date.)

## Delirium/Coma-Free Days

### Unadjusted Analysis

Due to the non-normal distribution of DCFDs `r spark_dcfd`, our primary
unadjusted analysis uses a Kruskal-Wallis test to look for any differences in
distribution of this outcome between the three treatment groups. Please see [the
Methods section](#unadjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand` randomized
patients are included.

We see no association between treatment group and DCFDs. 

```{r dcfds_describe}
label(inhosp_desc_df$dcfd_int) <- "Days alive, free of delirium & coma"
my_html(summaryM(dcfd_int ~ trt, data = inhosp_desc_df, test = TRUE),
        caption = "DCFDs")

```

```{r dcfds_unadj, results = "hide"}
## -- Test DCFDs by treatment group --------------------------------------------
dcfd_kw <- with(ptsummary_df, kruskal.test(x = dcfd_int, g = trt))

## -- Plot DCFDs by treatment group; include K-W results as subtitle -----------
dcfd_plot <- mental_plot(
  xvar = "dcfd_int", xtitle = "Delirium/Coma-Free Days", kw_obj = dcfd_kw
)

```

```{r print_dcfds_unadj, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 4}
dcfd_plot

```

### Adjusted Analysis

After adjusting for all baseline covariates, we again see no significant
association between treatment and days alive and free of delirium and coma
during the intervention period.

#### Model Fitting and Assumptions{.tabset}

##### Model Fitting

We use proportional odds logistic regression to look at the association between
treatment and DCFDs during the intervention period, adjusting for baseline
patient characteristics. Please see [the Methods section](#adjusted) for more
details. All `r n_rand_comp` randomized patients with complete covariate data
are included.

```{r dcfds_adj}
## Primary model fit using rms::orm(), because Liu & Shepherd have some nice
##  functions for getting means, etc from this. My function to check PO
##  assumption assumes rms::lrm() fit; one day I should make this flexible, but
##  for now, fit it twice. Results are identical when both use default options.
dcfd_mod <- orm(
  as.formula(paste("dcfd_int ~", mod_rhs)),
  data = model_df,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = model_df$study_site)

dcfd_mod_lrm <- lrm(
  as.formula(paste("dcfd_int ~", mod_rhs)),
  data = model_df,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = model_df$study_site)

```

##### Assumptions

We are looking for fairly flat lines, paying particular attention to panels
representing treatment groups. Please see the [Methods section](#assumptions)
for further details.

```{r dcfds_assume}
JTHelpers::rms_po_assume(
  dcfd_mod_lrm,
  cuts = seq(1, 12, 1),
  modelData = model_df
) +
  labs(title = "PO assumption for DCFDs") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8))

```

#### Model Results {.tabset}

We show the odds ratios (using placebo as reference) and adjusted medians for
DCFDs by treatment group.

##### Adjusted Odds Ratios

Odds ratios **higher** than 1 are favorable, indicating higher odds of more
"good" days alive and free of brain dysfunction.

```{r dcfd_ors, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 3}
## -- Create dataset of values to use when calculating conditional medians -----
## Since we use the same covariates for all three models, can use this dataset
## 1. Create data frame with a single row, excluding treatment values
##  (we'll add those later)
pred_df_org <- map_dfc(
  setdiff(c(cont_covars, notcont_covars), "trt"),
  get_adjvals,
  ddist = dd
)

## 2. Repeat those values by row; # rows = # different treatments
pred_df <- rep(list(pred_df_org), length(levels(model_df$trt))) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  ## Add treatment levels
  bind_cols(trt = levels(model_df$trt)) %>%
  ## Create a model.matrix object, then leave out the intercept
  ##   model.matrix() handles dummy variables for categoricals nicely
  model.matrix(
    as.formula(sprintf("~ %s", paste(names(.), collapse = " + "))),
    .
  ) %>%
  ## Could not get the contrasts argument to give me placebo as reference.
  ## Wrangle this thing by hand.
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::select(-1, -starts_with("trt")) %>%
  bind_cols(as.data.frame(contr.treatment(levels(model_df$trt), base = 1)))

## colnames must be the same as names(coef(model))
## We're using the same covariates for all models, so we can just use one
pred_df_names <- names(coef(dcfd_mod))
pred_df_names <- pred_df_names[grepl("^[^y>=]", pred_df_names)]
pred_df_names <- pred_df_names[grepl("^[^trt=]", pred_df_names)]
pred_df_names <-
  c(pred_df_names, paste0("trt=", c("Haloperidol", "Ziprasidone")))
names(pred_df) <- pred_df_names

## -- Calculate, plot odds ratios for both treatments vs placebo ---------------
dcfd_ors <- trt_ratios(mod = dcfd_mod)

dcfd_ors_plot <- plot_trt_ratios(
  ratio_df = dcfd_ors,
  "Delirium/Coma-Free Days",
  mod = dcfd_mod
)

dcfd_ors_plot

```

##### Adjusted Medians

Medians are adjusted to the median/mode values of all covariates, so that each
represents the expected median number of DCFDs for a patient in each treatment
group who is otherwise part of a "typical" *(many air quotes)* population.

```{r dcfd_medians, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
## Get adjusted medians + bounds for each treatment group
dcfd_adjmeds <- quantile_orm_df(mod = dcfd_mod)

## Plot medians + CIs
dcfd_adjmeds_plot <- mental_medians_plot(dcfd_adjmeds, dcfd_mod)

dcfd_adjmeds_plot

```

##### Results for All Covariates

Since most of the continuous covariates are modeled using restricted cubic
splines (see the [Methods section](#covariates) for more details), a single odds
ratio/CI is insufficient to describe the entire relationship between each of
these covariates and DCFDs. Rather, each odds ratio reflects a comparison
between two specific values of the covariate, as noted in the table.

```{r dcfd_full_results, warning = FALSE}
rms_results_kable(dcfd_mod_lrm)

```

## Delirium Duration

Delirium duration is an imperfect measure, since patients who die quickly can
have a short duration and appear to have better outcomes than they actually do.
It is included as a way to help elucidate any association between treatment and
our blunt primary outcome of DCFDs, which incorporates delirium and coma
durations as well as death.

### Unadjusted Analysis

Due to the non-normal distribution of delirium duration `r spark_del`, our
primary unadjusted analysis uses a Kruskal-Wallis test to look for any
differences in distribution of this outcome between the three treatment groups.
Please see [the Methods section](#unadjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand`
randomized patients are included.

We see no association between treatment and days of delirium during the
intervention period.

```{r del_describe}
label(inhosp_desc_df$del_int_all) <- "Days of delirium"
my_html(summaryM(del_int_all ~ trt, data = inhosp_desc_df, test = TRUE),
        caption = "Days of Delirium")

```

```{r del_unadj, results = "hide"}
## -- Test delirium duration by treatment group --------------------------------
del_kw <- with(model_df, kruskal.test(x = del_int_all, g = trt))

## -- Plot DCFDs by treatment group; include K-W results as subtitle -----------
del_plot <- mental_plot(
  xvar = "del_int_all", xtitle = "Delirium Duration", kw_obj = del_kw
)

```

```{r print_del_unadj, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 4}

```

### Adjusted Analysis

```

##### Assumptions

We are looking for fairly flat lines, paying particular attention to panels
representing treatment groups. Please see the [Methods section](#assumptions)
for further details.

```{r del_assume}
JTHelpers::rms_po_assume(
  del_mod_lrm,
  cuts = seq(2, 11, 1),
   ## Minimum value anyone should have is 1; start at >=2. Distribution after
   ## 7 is very sparse; no real reason to look, since it would be very noisy.
  modelData = model_df
) +
  labs(title = "PO assumption for delirium duration") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8))

```

#### Model Results {.tabset}

We show the odds ratios (using placebo as reference) and adjusted medians for
delirium duration by treatment group.

##### Adjusted Odds Ratios

Odds ratios **lower** than 1 are favorable, indicating lower odds of more days
with delirium.

```{r del_ors, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
## -- Calculate, plot odds ratios for both treatments vs placebo ---------------
del_ors <- trt_ratios(mod = del_mod)

del_ors_plot <- plot_trt_ratios(
  ratio_df = del_ors,
  "Delirium Duration",
  mod = del_mod
)

del_ors_plot

```

##### Adjusted Medians

Medians are adjusted to the median/mode values of all covariates, so that each
represents the expected median number of days with delirium for a patient in
each treatment group who is otherwise part of a "typical" *(many air quotes)*
population.

```{r del_medians, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
## Get adjusted medians + bounds for each treatment group
del_adjmeds <- quantile_orm_df(mod = del_mod)

## Plot medians + CIs
del_adjmeds_plot <- mental_medians_plot(del_adjmeds, del_mod)

del_adjmeds_plot

```

##### Results for All Covariates

Since most of the continuous covariates are modeled using restricted cubic
splines (see the [Methods section](#covariates) for more details), a single odds
ratio/CI is insufficient to describe the entire relationship between each of
these covariates and delirium duration. Rather, each odds ratio reflects a
comparison between two specific values of the covariate, as noted in the table.

```{r del_full_results, warning = FALSE}
rms_results_kable(del_mod_lrm)

```

## Duration of **Hyperactive** Delirium

In addition to *any* delirium, we are interested in any differential association
between treatment and either hypoactive or hyperactive delirium. Here, we look
at treatment vs hyperactive delirium, defined as delirium with a RASS > 0.

### Unadjusted Analysis

Due to the non-normal distribution of hyperactive delirium duration `r spark_hyperdel`, our primary unadjusted analysis uses a Kruskal-Wallis test to look for any differences in distribution of this outcome between the three
treatment groups. Please see [the Methods section](#unadjusted) for more
details. All `r n_rand` randomized patients are included.

We see no association between treatment and days of hyperactive delirium during
the intervention period.

```{r hyperdel_describe}
label(inhosp_desc_df$hyperdel_int_all) <- "Days of hyperactive delirium"
my_html(
  summaryM(
    hyperdel_int_all ~ trt, data = inhosp_desc_df, test = TRUE, continuous = 5
  ),

### Adjusted Analysis

After adjusting for all baseline covariates, we again see no significant association between treatment and days of hyperactive delirium during the
intervention period.

#### Model Fitting and Assumptions {.tabset}

##### Model Fitting

We use proportional odds logistic regression to look at the association between
treatment and duration of hyperactive delirium during the intervention period,
adjusting for baseline patient characteristics. Please see [the Methods section](#adjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand_comp` randomized patients
with complete covariate data are included.

```{r hyperdel_adj}
hyperdel_mod <- orm(
  as.formula(paste("hyperdel_int_all ~", mod_rhs)),
  data = model_df,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = model_df$study_site)

hyperdel_mod_lrm <- lrm(
  as.formula(paste("hyperdel_int_all ~", mod_rhs)),
  data = model_df,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = model_df$study_site)

```

##### Assumptions

We are looking for fairly flat lines, paying particular attention to panels
representing treatment groups. Please see the [Methods section](#assumptions)
for further details.

```{r hyperdel_assume}
JTHelpers::rms_po_assume(
  hyperdel_mod_lrm,
  cuts = seq(1, 4, 1),
   ## Distribution after 4 days is very sparse; no real reason to look, since it
   ## would be very noisy.
  modelData = model_df
) +
  labs(title = "PO assumption for duration of hyperactive delirium") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8))

```

#### Model Results {.tabset}

We show the odds ratios (using placebo as reference) and adjusted medians for
delirium duration by treatment group.
  
##### Adjusted Odds Ratios

Odds ratios **lower** than 1 are favorable, indicating lower odds of more days
with delirium.

```{r hyperdel_ors, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
## -- Calculate, plot odds ratios for both treatments vs placebo ---------------
hyperdel_ors <- trt_ratios(mod = hyperdel_mod)

hyperdel_ors_plot <- plot_trt_ratios(
  ratio_df = hyperdel_ors,
  "Duration of\nHyperactive Delirium",
  mod = hyperdel_mod
)

hyperdel_ors_plot

```

##### Adjusted Medians

Medians are adjusted to the median/mode values of all covariates, so that each
represents the expected median number of days with hyperactive delirium for a
patient in each treatment group who is otherwise part of a "typical" *(many air
quotes)* population.

```{r hyperdel_medians, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3}
## Get adjusted medians + bounds for each treatment group
hyperdel_adjmeds <- quantile_orm_df(mod = hyperdel_mod)

## Plot medians + CIs
hyperdel_adjmeds_plot <- mental_medians_plot(hyperdel_adjmeds, hyperdel_mod)

hyperdel_adjmeds_plot

```

##### Results for All Covariates

Since most of the continuous covariates are modeled using restricted cubic
splines (see the [Methods section](#covariates) for more details), a single odds
ratio/CI is insufficient to describe the entire relationship between each of
these covariates and delirium duration. Rather, each odds ratio reflects a
comparison between two specific values of the covariate, as noted in the table.

```{r hyperdel_full_results, warning = FALSE}
rms_results_kable(hyperdel_mod_lrm)

```

## Duration of **Hypoactive** Delirium

In addition to *any* delirium, we are interested in any differential association
between treatment and either hypoactive or hypoactive delirium. Here, we look
at treatment vs hypoactive delirium, defined as delirium with a RASS <= 0.

### Unadjusted Analysis

Due to the non-normal distribution of hypoactive delirium duration `r spark_hypodel`, our primary unadjusted analysis uses a Kruskal-Wallis test to look for any differences in distribution of this outcome between the three
treatment groups. Please see [the Methods section](#unadjusted) for more
details. All `r n_rand` randomized patients are included.

We see no association between treatment group and days of hypoactive delirium
during the intervention period.

```{r hypodel_describe}
label(inhosp_desc_df$hypodel_int_all) <- "Days of hypoactive delirium"
my_html(summaryM(hypodel_int_all ~ trt, data = inhosp_desc_df, test = TRUE),

```{r hypodel_full_results, warning = FALSE}
rms_results_kable(hypodel_mod_lrm)

## Coma Duration

Coma duration is an imperfect measure, since patients who die quickly can have a
short duration and appear to have better outcomes than they actually do. It is
included as a way to help elucidate any association between treatment and our
blunt primary outcome of DCFDs, which incorporates delirium and coma durations
as well as death.

### Unadjusted Analysis

Due to the non-normal distribution of coma duration `r spark_coma`, our
primary unadjusted analysis uses a Kruskal-Wallis test to look for any
differences in distribution of this outcome between the three treatment groups.
Please see [the Methods section](#unadjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand`
randomized patients are included.

We see no association between treatment and days of coma during the intervention
period.

```{r coma_describe}
label(inhosp_desc_df$coma_int_all) <- "Days of coma"

## Time to Death

We explore the association between treatment and time to death from all causes
within the 30 and 90 days following randomization.

### Censoring and Time to Event

#### 30-Day Mortality

- The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(studywd_ih == "Yes" & hospdis_noinfo))` patients
who withdrew from the study prior to day 30 with no known death status are censored at the time of withdrawal.
- The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(!hospdis_noinfo & !event_death_30 & tte_death_30 == 30.01))` patients who survived the entire 30-day period are censored at day
30.01.
- The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(!hospdis_noinfo & event_death_30 & tte_death_30 < 30.01))` patients who died within the 30-day period are assigned a time value
of `time of death - time of randomization`.

#### 90-Day Mortality

- The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(studywd_ih == "Yes" & hospdis_noinfo))` patients
who withdrew from the study prior to day 90 with no known death status are censored at the time of withdrawal.
- The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(!hospdis_noinfo & !event_death_90 & tte_death_90 == 90.01))` patients who survived the entire 90-day period are censored at day
90.01.
- The `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(!hospdis_noinfo & event_death_90 & tte_death_90 < 90.01))` patients who died within the 90-day period are assigned a time value
of `time of death - time of randomization`.

### Unadjusted Analysis{.tabset}

Our unadjusted analysis describes survival using Kaplan-Meier curves and tests
for differences among treatment groups in time to death within 30 and within 90
days of randomization using the log-rank test. All `r n_rand` randomized
patients are included.

We see no association between treatment group and death at either 30 or 90 days.

```{r death_unadj}
## -- Create Surv, survfit objects for time to death ---------------------------
surv_death_30 <-
  with(model_df, Surv(time = tte_death_30, event = event_death_30))
sf_death_30 <- survfit(
  surv_death_30 ~ trt,
  data = model_df %>%
    mutate(
      trt = factor(trt, levels = c("Ziprasidone", "Haloperidol", "Placebo"))
    )
)

surv_death_90 <-
  with(model_df, Surv(time = tte_death_90, event = event_death_90))
sf_death_90 <- survfit(
  surv_death_90 ~ trt,
  data = model_df %>%
    mutate(
      trt = factor(trt, levels = c("Ziprasidone", "Haloperidol", "Placebo"))
    )
)

## -- Log-rank test ------------------------------------------------------------
logrank_death_30 <- survdiff(surv_death_30 ~ trt, data = model_df)
logrank_death_90 <- survdiff(surv_death_90 ~ trt, data = model_df)
## -- Create KM curves, N at risk tables ---------------------------------------
km_death_30 <- km_plot_death(sf = sf_death_30, lr = logrank_death_30, time = 30)
km_death_90 <- km_plot_death(sf = sf_death_90, lr = logrank_death_90, time = 90)

```

#### 30-Day Death

```{r death_30_km, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 6}
km_death_30

```

#### 90-Day Death

```{r death_90_km, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 6}
km_death_90

```

### Adjusted Analysis

After adjusting for all baseline covariates, we again see no significant association between treatment and time to death within 30 days. We also see no
significant association between treatment and time to death within 90 days;
the confidence interval for haloperidol vs placebo does come quite close to
significance for this time point, which could be worth further investigation.

#### Model Fitting and Assumptions {.tabset}

We perform multivariable regression analyses using a Cox proportional hazards
model to explore the association between treatment group and time to death while
adjusting for potential baseline confounders. Please see the [Methods
section](#adjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand_comp` randomized patients
with complete covariate data are included.

##### Model Fitting

```{r death_adj, results = "hide"}
death_30_mod <- cph(
  as.formula(paste("surv_death_30 ~", mod_rhs)),
  data = model_df,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = model_df$study_site)

death_90_mod <- cph(
  as.formula(paste("surv_death_90 ~", mod_rhs)),
  data = model_df,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = model_df$study_site)

```

##### Assumptions, 30-Day Death

We are looking for generally flat lines, indicating consistent hazards over time
and paying particular attention to treatment group. For more details, please see
the [Methods section](#assumptions).

```{r death_30_assume}
## -- Check proportional hazard assumption -------------------------------------
death_30_zph <- cox.zph(death_30_mod, transform = 'log')

## Extract p-value for global PH assumption; create reproducible statement

```

`r death_30_phtext`

```{r death_30_assumeplot}
plot_ph_assume(death_30_zph)

```

##### Assumptions, 90-Day Death

We are looking for generally flat lines, indicating consistent hazards over time
and paying particular attention to treatment group. For more details, please see
the [Methods section](#assumptions).

```{r death_90_assume}
## -- Check proportional hazard assumption -------------------------------------

##### Hazard Ratios {.tabset}

```{r death_hrs}
## -- Calculate, plot hazard ratios for both treatments vs placebo -------------
death_30_hrs <- trt_ratios(death_30_mod)

## Create example text for interpretation
death_30_text <- hr_example(hr_df = death_30_hrs, outcome = "death")
death_90_text <- hr_example(hr_df = death_90_hrs, outcome = "death")

```

We show the hazard ratios for haloperidol and ziprasidone vs placebo. Hazard
ratios **lower** than 1 are favorable, indicating lower likelihood of death at
any given time point within 30 days of randomization, given that the patient has
survived up to that point. `r death_30_text[["Haloperidol"]]`

###### 30-Day Death

```{r death_30_hrs_plot, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}

```

##### Results for All Covariates {.tabset}

Since most of the continuous covariates are modeled using restricted cubic
splines (see the [Methods section](#covariates) for more details), a single
hazard ratio/CI is insufficient to describe the entire relationship between each
of these covariates and death. Rather, each hazard ratio reflects a comparison
between two specific values of the covariate, as noted in the table.

## Time to Successful ICU Discharge

We use time to event analysis with competing risks to explore the relationship
between treatment group and "successful" ICU discharge, defined as the final ICU
discharge from the study hospitalization, followed by at least 48 hours alive.
We treat death as a competing risk, and look at successful ICU discharge up to
90 days after randomization.

**Censoring and time to events:**

- We censor at the time of study withdrawal `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_icudis_90 == "Censored" & tte_icudis_90 < 90.01))` patients who
withdrew from the study prior to hospital discharge, with no discharge or death
information available.
- We censor at day 90.01 `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_icudis_90 == "Censored" & tte_icudis_90 == 90.01))` patients who survived the entire 90-day period but
remained in the ICU on day 90.
- We assign the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_icudis_90 == "Death"))` patients who died prior to ICU discharge within the 90-day period a time value of `time of death - time of randomization` and a "failure type" of death; we assign the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_icudis_90 == "ICU Discharge"))` patients who
were successfully discharged within the 90-day period a time value of `time of discharge - time of randomization` and a "failure type" of ICU discharge.

### Unadjusted Analysis

We present cumulative incidence plots by treatment group for both ICU discharge
and death, unadjusted for any covariates. Please see the [Methods
section](#unadjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand` randomized patients are
included.

We see no association between treatment and time to either ICU discharge or
the competing risk of death.

### Adjusted Analysis

After adjusting for baseline covariates, we still see no significant association
between treatment and relative incidence of ICU discharge.

#### Model Fitting and Assumptions {.tabset}

We use Fine & Gray's[^fg] method of competing risks regression to examine the
relationship between treatment and (primarily) ICU discharge. For further
details, please see the [Methods section](#adjusted). All `r n_rand_comp` randomized patients with complete covariate data are included.

##### Model Fitting

```{r icudis_90_adj}
## -- Fit competing risks model using survival::finegray(), rms::cph() ---------
## Note: I tested three separate methods to make sure results were consistent:
## cmprsk, survival, and rms. Results in this gist:
## https://gist.github.com/jenniferthompson/c66d1aa6060d3e8919ea917f7aa94288

## -- Create dataset specifically for Fine-Gray method of competing risks ------
icudis_90_fg <- finegray(
  ## Use **linear** RHS here; we'll fit spline terms within model formula itself
  as.formula(paste("icudis_90_Surv ~", mod_rhs_lin)),
  data = model_df,
  etype = "ICU Discharge",
  id = id,

)

## -- Fit actual model, using variables/weights from finegray() ----------------

  data = icudis_90_fg,
  weights = fgwt,
  x = TRUE, y = TRUE
) %>%
  robcov(cluster = icudis_90_fg$study_site)

```

##### Assumptions

```

##### Results for All Covariates

Since most of the continuous covariates are modeled using restricted cubic
splines (see the [Methods section](#covariates) for more details), a single
subdistribution hazard ratio/CI is insufficient to describe the entire
relationship between each of these covariates and the relative incidence of ICU
discharge. Rather, each subdistribution hazard ratio reflects a comparison
between two specific values of the covariate, as noted in the table.

```{r icudis_90_full_results, warning = FALSE}

```

## Time to Successful Hospital Discharge

We use time to event analysis with competing risks to explore the relationship
between treatment group and "successful" hospital discharge, defined as discharge from the study hospitalization, followed by at least 48 hours alive.
We treat death as a competing risk, and look at successful hospital discharge up
to 90 days after randomization.

**Censoring and time to events:**

- We censor at the time of study withdrawal `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_hospdis_90 == "Censored" & tte_hospdis_90 < 90.01))` patients who withdrew from the study prior to hospital discharge, with no discharge or death
information available.
- We censor at day 90.01 `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_hospdis_90 == "Censored" & tte_hospdis_90 == 90.01))` patients who survived the entire 90-day
period but remained hospitalized on day 90.
- We assign the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_hospdis_90 == "Death"))` patients who died prior to ICU discharge within the 90-day period a time value
of `time of death - time of randomization` and a "failure type" of death; we
assign the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_hospdis_90 == "Hospital Discharge"))`
patients who were successfully discharged within the 90-day period a time value
of `time of discharge - time of randomization` and a "failure type" of hospital
discharge.

### Unadjusted Analysis

We present cumulative incidence plots by treatment group for both hospital
discharge and death, unadjusted for any covariates. Please see the [Methods
section](#unadjusted) for more details. All `r n_rand` randomized patients are
included.

We see no association between treatment and time to successful hospital
discharge.

### Adjusted Analysis

After adjusting for baseline covariates, we still see no significant association
between treatment and relative incidence of successful hospital discharge.

#### Model Fitting and Assumptions {.tabset}

We use Fine & Gray's[^fg] method of competing risks regression to examine the
relationship between treatment and (primarily) hospital discharge. For further
details, please see the [Methods section](#adjusted). All `r n_rand_comp` randomized patients with complete covariate data are included.

## Time to Successful Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation

We use time to event analysis with competing risks to explore the relationship
between treatment group and "successful" liberation from mechanical ventilation,
defined as discontinuation of all types of MV followed by at least 48 hours alive and without reinitiation of MV, during the 30 days following
randomization. We treat death and hospital discharge without liberation during
this time as separate competing risks.

**Censoring and time to events:**

- We censor at the time of study withdrawal `r with(ptsummary_df, sum(ftype_mvlib_30 == "Censored" & tte_mvlib_30 < 30.01 & hospdis_noinfo, na.rm = TRUE))` patients who withdrew from the study prior to hospital discharge,
with no discharge or death information available.
- We censor at day 30.01 `r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(ftype_mvlib_30 == "Censored" & tte_mvlib_30 == 30.01))` patients who survived the entire 30-day
period after randomization, but remained hospitalized on day 30.
- We assign patients who experience the competing risks of either hospital discharge (`r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(ftype_mvlib_30 == "Discharge" & tte_mvlib_30 < 30.01 & !hospdis_noinfo))` patients) or death (`r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(ftype_mvlib_30 == "Death" & tte_mvlib_30 < 30.01 & !hospdis_noinfo))` patients) prior to 30 days a time to event of `time of discharge/death - time of randomization` and a "failure type" of hospital
discharge and death, respectively.
- We assign the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(ftype_mvlib_30 == "MV Liberation"))` patients who were successfully liberated from MV within 30 days
of randomization a time value of `time of liberation - time of randomization`
and a "failure type" of liberation from MV.

### Unadjusted Analysis

We present cumulative incidence plots by treatment group for both liberation
from MV and death, unadjusted for any covariates. Please see the [Methods
section](#unadjusted) for more details. All `r  sum_na(ptsummary_df$on_mv_rand24)` randomized patients who were on MV within 24 hours after randomization are included.

We see no association between treatment and time to successful liberation from
mechanical ventilation.

## Time to ICU Readmission

We use time to event analysis with competing risks to explore the relationship
between treatment group and readmission to the ICU within 90 days of first
discharge during the index hospitalization, among the `r sum_na(ptsummary_df$elig_readm)` patients who survived their first ICU stay and
remained in the study. We treat death and hospital discharge without readmission
during this time as separate competing risks.

Although the question of how _many_ times each patient was readmitted is also
of interest, we had so few patients who were readmitted >1 time (`r with(subset(ptsummary_df, elig_readm), sum_na(icu_readmit_number > 1))`, or `r with(subset(ptsummary_df, elig_readm), round(mean_na(icu_readmit_number > 1) * 100))`%) that it was not feasible to address this specific issue.

**Censoring and time to events:**

- We planned to censor at the time of study withdrawal patients who withdrew
from the study prior to hospital discharge with no discharge or death information available, but `r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(elig_readm & ftype_readm_90 == "Censored" & tte_readm_90 < 90.01))` patients met this criteria.
- We censored at day 90.01 `r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(elig_readm & ftype_readm_90 == "Censored" & tte_readm_90 == 90.01))` patient(s) who survived
the entire 90-day period after initial discharge, but remained hospitalized on
day 90.
- We assign patients who experience the competing risks of either hospital discharge (`r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(elig_readm & ftype_readm_90 == "Discharge" & tte_readm_90 < 90.01 & !hospdis_noinfo))` patients) or death (`r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(elig_readm & ftype_readm_90 == "Death" & tte_readm_90 < 90.01 & !hospdis_noinfo))` patients) prior to 90 days after first ICU
discharge a time to event of `time of discharge/death - time of randomization` and a "failure type" of hospital discharge and death, respectively.
- We assign the `r with(ptsummary_df, sum_na(elig_readm & ftype_readm_90 == "Readmission"))` patients who were readmitted to the ICU within 90 days of
first discharge a time value of `time of readmission - time of first ICU discharge` and a "failure type" of readmission.

### Unadjusted Analysis

We present cumulative incidence plots by treatment group for ICU readmission,
hospital discharge without readmission, and death, unadjusted for any
covariates. Please see the [Methods section](#unadjusted) for more details. All
`r  sum_na(ptsummary_df$elig_readm)` randomized patients who survived their
initial ICU admission and remained in the study are included.

We see no association between treatment group and rates of ICU readmission

from their first ICU stay.

##### Assumptions

Due to only a single patient being censored, the interaction between transformed
time and Schoenfeld residuals could not be properly calculated. We instead look
at the log(-log(Survival time)) vs log(time) for treatment groups only, looking for parallel lines which indicate that the proportional hazards assumption is
met. We do not calculate a p-value.

##### Results for All Covariates

Since most of the continuous covariates are modeled using restricted cubic
splines (see the [Methods section](#covariates) for more details), a single
subdistribution hazard ratio/CI is insufficient to describe the entire
relationship between each of these covariates and the relative incidence of
ICU readmission. Rather, each subdistribution hazard ratio reflects a
comparison between two specific values of the covariate, as noted in the table.

# Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect
<hr>

Our goal in this section is to determine whether there is any difference in the
association between treatment and each outcome depending on any of the following
baseline factors:
  
1. Age at study consent
1. Severity of illness at randomization, measured by modified SOFA
1. Preexisting cognitive impairment, measured by IQCODE
1. Medical vs surgical admission reason
1. Sepsis/septic shock at ICU admission

Detailed definitions for each of these potential modifiers of treatment effect will be included with each section, if needed.

## Age at Study Consent

Age is included as a continuous variable in both the main effect and interaction terms of each model, using restricted cubic splines to allow a nonlinear
association between age and each outcome. For purposes of interpretation, we
present the relationships between treatment and outcome adjusted to the 10th,
25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of age in our randomized cohort.

```

The association between treatment and our primary outcome of delirium/coma-free
days is consistent regardless of age; though the oldest patients tend to have
the fewest days alive and free of delirium and coma as a group, the median
DCFDs for each treatment group still overlap considerably at each age presented,
indicating no difference in the effect of treatment on this outcome. Treatment
effect (or lack thereof) is similarly consistent for duration of hyperactive
delirium.

Among the youngest patients, the ziprasidone group has fewer days of delirium
(and specifically hypoactive delirium), but also a slightly elevated hazard
ratio for death compared to the placebo group. This big-picture interpretation is reflected by the lack of effect modification for the broad outcome of DCFDs,
but may be worth further investigation. Haloperidol is potentially associated
with a higher risk of death by both 30 and 90 days after randomization among the
oldest patients.

### Mental Status Outcomes{.tabset}

Medians are adjusted to the median/mode values of all covariates except age and
treatment, so that each represents the expected median number of DCFDs (for
example) for a patient in each treatment group who is otherwise part of a
"typical" *(many air quotes)* population.

## Severity of Illness at Randomization

"Severity of illness" is here defined as the SOFA score for each patient on the
day of randomization to study drug (excluding the SOFA's central nervous system
component). For further details on how the SOFA was calculated, please see [below](#soi). Modified SOFA is included as a continuous variable in both the
main effect and interaction terms of each model, using restricted cubic splines
to allow a nonlinear association between it and each outcome. For purposes of
interpretation, we present the relationships between treatment and outcome
adjusted to the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of modified SOFA in
our randomized cohort.

```

For most outcomes, associations between treatment and outcome are generally
consistent regardless of severity of illness at randomization; for example,
though the sickest patients tend to have the fewest days alive and free of
delirium and coma as a group, the median DCFDs for each treatment group still
overlap considerably at each level of modified SOFA presented, indicating no
difference in the effect of treatment on this outcome.

The single exception is 90-day mortality, where haloperidol seems to be
associated with a higher rate of death for patients with moderate severity of
illness. Given the lack of overall association between treatment and mortality,
and the lack of effect modification between SOI and treatment for 30-day
mortality, this should be interpreted with caution, and together with 12-month
mortality results when follow-up assessments are complete.

## Pre-Existing Cognitive Impairment

We measure cognitive impairment prior to ICU admission via the [IQCODE](http://www.cochrane.org/CD011333/DEMENTIA_using-structured-questionnaire-iqcode-detect-individuals-who-may-go-develop-dementia), usually administered
to the patient's surrogate. IQCODE is included as a linear, continuous variable
in both the main effect and interaction terms of each model. For purposes of
interpretation, we present the relationships between treatment and outcome
adjusted to the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of IQCODE in our
randomized cohort; however, due to the distribution of IQCODE (heavily
concentrated at 3 `r spark_iqcode`) and low rates of pre-existing cognitive
impairment in our cohort, these percentiles may result in fewer than 5 unique
values.

```{r em_prep_iqcode}
## -- Create model RHS ---------------------------------------------------------
## Reminder: IQCODE is forced to be *linear* due to its distribution
mod_rhs_iqcode <- map_chr(
  cont_covars, ~ sprintf("rcs(%s, %s)", ., rcsknots)

## -- Create dataset of values to use when calculating conditional medians -----
## Use same values (median/mode) for everything except treatment and IQCODE
## Applies to all mental status outcomes

## Specify IQCODE values
vals_iqcode <- quantile(
  model_df$iqcode_total_ph, probs = em_quants, na.rm = TRUE
) %>%
  unique()

## Get matrix of treatment indicators:
##  Could not get the contrasts argument of model.matrix() to give me placebo
##  as reference. Create by hand.
trt_matrix_iqcode <- bind_rows(
  ## Get treatment indicator values, repeat as needed given vals_iqcode
  rep(
    list(as.data.frame(contr.treatment(levels(model_df$trt), base = 1))),
    length(vals_iqcode)
  )
) %>%
  ## Sort to group all placebo, haloperidol, ziprasidone rows together
  arrange(Ziprasidone, Haloperidol)

## Replace IQCODE columns in pred_df_org with updated IQCODE values
pred_df_iqcode_prep <- pred_df_org %>%
  dplyr::select(-starts_with("iqcode_total_ph")) %>%
  bind_rows(rep(list(.), length(vals_iqcode) - 1)) %>%
  bind_cols(data.frame(iqcode_total_ph = vals_iqcode))

## Repeat those values for each treatment
pred_df_iqcode <-
  rep(list(pred_df_iqcode_prep), length(levels(model_df$trt))) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  ## Add treatment levels to dataset
  bind_cols(trt = rep(levels(model_df$trt), nrow(pred_df_iqcode_prep))) %>%
  
  ## Create a model.matrix object, then leave out the intercept
  ##   model.matrix() handles dummy variables for categoricals nicely
  model.matrix(
    as.formula(sprintf("~ %s", paste(names(.), collapse = " + "))),
    .
  ) %>%
  ## Could not get the contrasts argument to give me placebo as reference.
  ## Wrangle this thing by hand.
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ## Remove intercept, original treatment columns
  dplyr::select(-1, -starts_with("trt")) %>%

  bind_cols(trt_matrix_iqcode) %>%
  
  ## Create interaction values
  mutate(
    iqcode_halop = iqcode_total_ph * Haloperidol,
    iqcode_zipras = iqcode_total_ph * Ziprasidone
  )
  
```

Though we see some statistically significant heterogeneity of effect, the
adjusted differences do not seem to be clinically meaningful. The possible exception is ICU readmission; patients with the worst pre-existing cognitive impairment who were randomized to haloperidol had the highest adjusted rate of ICU readmission. This is worthy of further investigation; we also, however, note
our low rates of readmission generally, and the wide confidence interval
surrounding this estimate.

and treatment, so that each represents the expected median number of DCFDs
(for example) for a patient in each treatment group who is otherwise part of a "typical" *(many air quotes)* population.

## Medical vs Surgical ICU

"Surgical ICU patients" include patients who meet at least one of the following
criteria:

- Have a recorded primary ICU admission reason involving “surgery”
- Had emergency or elective surgery between hospital admission and ICU admission
- Went to the OR between ICU admission and study enrollment

Patients meeting none of the above criteria are considered to be medical ICU
patients.

ICU type is included as a dichotomous variable, as both a main effect (not
included in our primary analyses) and interacting with treatment. All main
effects included in the primary adjusted models are also included in these
exploratory models.

```{r em_prep_medsurg}
## -- Create model RHS ---------------------------------------------------------

  cont_covars, ~ sprintf("rcs(%s, %s)", ., rcsknots)
) %>%

## Use same values (median/mode) for everything except treatment and IQCODE
## Applies to all mental status outcomes

    length(vals_medsurg)
  )
) %>%
  ## Sort to group all placebo, haloperidol, ziprasidone rows together
  arrange(Ziprasidone, Haloperidol)

## Replace ICU type columns in pred_df_org with updated IQCODE values
pred_df_medsurg_prep <- pred_df_org %>%
  bind_rows(rep(list(.), length(vals_medsurg) - 1)) %>%
  bind_cols(data.frame(med_surg = vals_medsurg))

## Repeat those values for each treatment
pred_df_medsurg <-
  rep(list(pred_df_medsurg_prep), length(levels(model_df$trt))) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  ## Add treatment levels to dataset
  bind_cols(trt = rep(levels(model_df$trt), nrow(pred_df_medsurg_prep))) %>%
  
  ## Create a model.matrix object, then leave out the intercept
  ##   model.matrix() handles dummy variables for categoricals nicely
  model.matrix(
    as.formula(sprintf("~ %s", paste(names(.), collapse = " + "))),

  ## Could not get the contrasts argument to give me placebo as reference.
  ## Wrangle this thing by hand.

  ## Create interaction values
  mutate(
    medsurg_halop = med_surg * Haloperidol,
    medsurg_zipras = med_surg * Ziprasidone
  )
  
```

Aside from coma duration (where any effect modification is clinically minimal)
and potentially liberation from mechanical ventilation, where ziprasidone may
have some benefit among surgical patients, we see no effect modification from
ICU type and the association between treatment and any of our primary or
secondary outcomes.

## Sepsis/Septic Shock at ICU Admission

This section examines potential effect modification of the association between
treatment and outcomes by whether patients had a recorded primary reason for ICU
admission of sepsis/septic shock. Sepsis at admission is included as a
dichotomous variable, as both a main effect (not included in our primary
analyses) and interacting with treatment. All main effects included in the
primary adjusted models are also included in these exploratory models.

```{r em_prep_sepsis}
## -- Create model RHS ---------------------------------------------------------
mod_rhs_sepsis <- map_chr(
  cont_covars, ~ sprintf("rcs(%s, %s)", ., rcsknots)
) %>%
  c(., setdiff(notcont_covars, "trt")) %>%
  c(., "sepsis_adm * trt") %>%
  paste(collapse = " + ")

## -- Create dataset of values to use when calculating conditional medians -----
## Use same values (median/mode) for everything except treatment and sepsis
## Applies to all mental status outcomes

## Specify sepsis values: 0 = medical, 1 = surgical
vals_sepsis <- 0:1

## Get matrix of treatment indicators:
##  Could not get the contrasts argument of model.matrix() to give me placebo
##  as reference. Create by hand.
trt_matrix_sepsis <- bind_rows(
  ## Get treatment indicator values, repeat as needed given vals_iqcode
  rep(
    list(as.data.frame(contr.treatment(levels(model_df$trt), base = 1))),
    length(vals_sepsis)
  )
) %>%
  ## Sort to group all placebo, haloperidol, ziprasidone rows together
  arrange(Ziprasidone, Haloperidol)

## Replace sepsis columns in pred_df_org with updated sepsis values
pred_df_sepsis_prep <- pred_df_org %>%
  bind_rows(rep(list(.), length(vals_sepsis) - 1)) %>%
  bind_cols(data.frame(sepsis_adm = vals_sepsis))

## Repeat those values for each treatment
pred_df_sepsis <-
  rep(list(pred_df_sepsis_prep), length(levels(model_df$trt))) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  ## Add treatment levels to dataset
  bind_cols(trt = rep(levels(model_df$trt), nrow(pred_df_sepsis_prep))) %>%
  
  ## Create a model.matrix object, then leave out the intercept
  ##   model.matrix() handles dummy variables for categoricals nicely
  model.matrix(
    as.formula(sprintf("~ %s", paste(names(.), collapse = " + "))),
    .
  ) %>%
  ## Could not get the contrasts argument to give me placebo as reference.
  ## Wrangle this thing by hand.
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ## Remove intercept, original treatment columns
  dplyr::select(-1, -starts_with("trt")) %>%
  ## Add my own treatment columns, created above
  bind_cols(trt_matrix_sepsis) %>%
  
  ## Create interaction values
  mutate(
    sepsis_halop = sepsis_adm * Haloperidol,
    sepsis_zipras = sepsis_adm * Ziprasidone
  )
  
```

Among patients septic/in septic shock at ICU readmission, ziprasidone treatment
is associated with a small increase in coma duration, and both antipsychotics
(but particularly haloperidol) are associated with a small decrease in time to
ICU discharge compared to placebo.

### Mental Status Outcomes{.tabset}

Medians are adjusted to the median/mode values of all covariates except sepsis
and treatment, so that each represents the expected median number of DCFDs
(for example) for a patient in each treatment group who is otherwise part of a "typical" *(many air quotes)* population.

# Code for Creation of Publication Figures

These figures combine results included in separate sections earlier in this
document. The goal is to create high-resolution graphics for both manuscript
publication and future presentations.

Listing of planned figures in primary manuscript:

1. CONSORT information (done by clinical authors; information provided in [*Screening, Consent, and Randomization*](#screening))
1. Mental status outcomes: medians, DCFDs, delirium, coma duration
1. Survival: 90-day KM curve, including results from 30 + 90-day models
1. Cumulative incidence curves: ICU discharge, hospital discharge, MV liberation, ICU readmission (outcomes of interest only)

Planned figures for supplement:

1. Medians, hypoactive/hyperactive delirium
1. Adjusted hazard ratios for all TTE outcomes
1. Complete cumulative incidence curves for all TTE outcomes, including curves for death/discharge and N at risk
1. Effect modification figures

## Mental Status Outcomes, Primary Analysis

*Suggested caption:*

During the 14-day treatment period, the primary outcome (delirium/coma-free days) and secondary outcomes (durations of delirium and coma) were similar in the three treatment groups. P-values are computed for the entire association between treatment and the outcome. Medians and p-values are calculated using proportional odds logistic regression clustered by study site, and are adjusted for age at study consent; preexisting cognitive impairment (IQCODE), frailty (CSHA Clinical Frailty Score), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidities Index); and severity of illness (modified SOFA) and level of arousal (RASS) at randomization.

(Similar for appendix, hyperactive/hypoactive delirium.)

## 90-Day Survival

*Suggested caption:*

The study population had 73% survival at 30 days and 65% survival at 90 days. In adjusted analyses, neither haloperidol (...) nor ziprasidone (...) affected 30-day survival compared with placebo (across groups, adjusted P = ...). Ziprasidone had no effect on 90-day survival (HR...); haloperidol's effect on 90-day survival trended toward harm in adjusted analyses (HR...). P-values for
30- and 90-day death refer to the entire association between treatment and mortality and are calculated using Cox proportional hazards models clustered by study site. Models are adjusted for age at study consent; preexisting cognitive impairment (IQCODE), frailty (CSHA Clinical Frailty Score), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidities Index); and severity of illness (modified SOFA) and level of arousal (RASS) at randomization.

## Cumulative Incidence Curves

In the main manuscript, we will include only the cumulative incidence curves for
the primary distribution of interest (eg, only ICU discharge, not death), in order to create a single paneled figure with all outcomes. In the supplement, we
will include full CIF curves as well as the N at risk tables for each outcome.

### Main Paper

*Suggested caption:*

There were no differences between treatment groups in time to liberation from mechanical ventilation, ICU discharge, or hospital discharge. In adjusted analyses there was a difference in ICU readmission across groups, with patients treated with ziprasidone having a slightly lower readmission rate among those who survived their initial ICU stay. P-values refer to the overall effect of treatment. They are calculated using the Fine-Gray method for competing risks (clustered by study site), and adjusted for age at study consent; preexisting cognitive impairment (IQCODE), frailty (CSHA Clinical Frailty Score), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidities Index); and severity of illness (modified SOFA) and level of arousal (RASS) at randomization.

### Online Supplement

*Suggested caption:*

[These figures] present the cumulative incidence probabilities for time-to-event
outcomes, alongside those for competing risks of death and (where appropriate)
ICU discharge prior to the event of interest. All four outcomes have a competing risk of death prior to the event; ICU readmission and liberation from mechanical ventilation also have a competing risk of ICU discharge prior to the event.
P-values refer to the overall effect of treatment. They are calculated using the
Fine-Gray method for competing risks (clustered by study site), and adjusted for
age at study consent; preexisting cognitive impairment (IQCODE), frailty (CSHA
Clinical Frailty Score), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidities Index); and
severity of illness (modified SOFA) and level of arousal (RASS) at
randomization.

## Adjusted Subdistribution Hazard Ratios, All Time-to-Event Outcomes

*Suggested caption:*

[This figure] presents adjusted hazard ratios for haloperidol and ziprasidone vs
placebo for each time-to-event outcome. Hazard ratios are calculated using Cox
proportional hazards regression (death) or Fine-Gray competing risks models (all
other outcomes), with competing risks of death and, for MV liberation and ICU readmission, discharge prior to the primary event of interest. All are adjusted
for age at study consent; preexisting cognitive impairment (IQCODE), frailty
(CSHA Clinical Frailty Score), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidities Index); and severity of illness (modified SOFA) and level of arousal (RASS) at
randomization.

Death and hospital and ICU discharge are analyzed among all `r n_rand` randomized patients. Liberation from mechanical ventilation is analyzed among
the `r sum_na(ptsummary_df$on_mv_rand24)` randomized patients who received
either type of mechanical ventilation at or within 24 hours after randomization.
ICU readmission is analyzed only among the `r sum_na(ptsummary_df$elig_readm)`
randomized patients who survived their initial ICU stay and were discharged to
the floor.

### Adjusted Medians for Time-to-Event Outcomes

*Suggested captions:*

[These figures] present the relationship between treatment and mental status
outcomes at various levels of [age, IQCODE, sepsis, ICU type, SOFA] among all
`r n_rand` randomized patients. Medians and confidence limits are calculated
using proportional odds logistic regression and adjusted for age at study
consent; preexisting cognitive impairment (IQCODE), frailty (CSHA Clinical Frailty Score), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidities Index); and severity of illness (modified SOFA) and level of arousal (RASS) at randomization.

# Notes on Variable Calculation{#varcalc}

<hr>

## Severity of Illness{#soi}

Due to the nature of clinical data collection, we had some missing values for APACHE II and SOFA components despite our coordinators' best efforts. We handled these missing values in the following ways:

### APACHE II (ICU admission only)

- Oxygenation: If no arterial blood gas was done, we converted the lowest O2 saturation to PaO2 per the [EPIC II conversions](http://intensive.org/epic2/Documents/Estimation%20of%20PO2%20and%20FiO2.pdf) and assigned points based on PaO2 alone. O2 saturations below the lowest level included in the conversion table were assigned the lowest PaO2; O2 saturations of 100 were assigned the highest PaO2.
- pH: If no arterial blood gas was done, we used the serum HCO3 conversions noted in the original reference.
- Glasgow Coma Score: If no GCS was available, we assigned points for the APACHE using the lowest RASS on the day of ICU admission using [Vasilevskis et al's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748963/) point values for the SOFA.
- All other components: If no values were available on a given day, we looked for a value on the closest day within the three full days after ICU admission. If none was available, we assumed that no measurement implied no clinical reason to suspect dysfunction, and assigned a normal value (0 points).

### SOFA (ICU admission + daily throughout intervention period)

- Substitutions for specific components:
    - Respiratory: If P/F ratio was not available, we used the lowest S/F ratio, per [Pandharipande et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19242333).
    - Central nervous system: If no GCS was available, we used the lowest RASS available that day, per [Vasilevskis et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748963/), method C.
- Missing data at ICU admission:

    Using only data from ICU admission, there are `r sum(is.na(ptsummary_all_df$sofa_adm_only))` consented patients and  `r sum(is.na(ptsummary_df$sofa_adm_only))` randomized patients missing at least one SOFA component score. For these patients' missing components, we imputed the next available value within the following two calendar days. If none was available, we assumed a normal value (0 points). (This could happen either because there was no clinical reason to order labs, or because the patient was not consented within three days of ICU admission and thus no study data was collected in that period.)
    
- Missing data during the intervention period:
    - We were unable to calculate SOFA scores using raw data on `r sum(is.na(subset(daily_int_df, study_status == "Intervention")$sofa_raw))` patient-days during the study period (randomization + 13 days). *(Missingness is much higher after the official intervention/post-intervention periods, when patients were no longer being actively followed for daily data collection. However, in this analysis we are only concerned about the official 14-day study period.)*
    - If the data required to calculate a given component was unavailable, we imputed the closest non-missing component score before *or* after the missing day, up to two full days away (missing day +/-2 days). If data was available X days both before *and* after the missing day, we prioritized past over future values.
    - If, after this imputation, values are still missing, we assume that no available data indicates no clinical reason to suspect organ dysfunction and therefore impute a normal value for that component. Again, this applies to `r sum(is.na(subset(daily_int_df, study_status == "Intervention")$sofa_raw))` patient-days during the study period.
        
## Medications

- **Benzodiazepines** include midazolam, lorazepam, and/or diazepam. Doses are expressed in midazolam equivalents.
- **Opioids** include fentanyl, morphine, and/or hydromorphone. Doses are expressed in fentanyl equivalents.
- **Antipsychotics** include open-label haloperidol, open-label ziprasidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine (including in combination with fluoxetine), and/or risperidone. Doses are expressed in haloperidol equivalents.
- All conversion formulas can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZGfxAmTFxGgfzjwE0trrpKEn_21QDwCSGJIv-E5kiE4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Mechanical Ventilation

During the course of the study, patients could be on invasive mechanical ventilation (invasive MV), noninvasive positive pressure support (NIPPV), both,
or neither. For our purposes, "time on MV" describes the number of days each patient was on *either* type of ventilation beginning at the time of
randomization, **including** time between discontinuation of MV and reinitiation
or death, if that time is less than 48 hours. (In other words, if a patient was extubated at 12pm and died at 3pm, those final three hours are included in the total time on MV.)

"Liberation from mechanical ventilation" indicates the first discontinuation of either type of MV which was followed by at least 48 hours alive without reinitiation of MV.

## Delirium/Coma-Free Days (+ Other Mental Status Variables){#dcfds}

This primary outcome variable is calculated over the 14 days including and immediately following randomization. It is defined as days alive and without brain dysfunction.

For example, a patient who was delirious on the day of consent and the day following; had one day of normal status; again became delirious for one day; and was then comatose for two days before dying in the ICU would have `14 - (3 days delirium + 2 days coma + 8 days deceased) =` 1 DCFD.

### Determining Mental Status Using CAM and RASS

We determined mental status for a given *assessment* using the following criteria:

1. **Comatose**: RASS -4 or -5, **or** RASS missing and CAM Unable to Assess
1. **Delirious**: RASS missing or >= -3, and CAM Positive
    - Hyperactive delirium: Delirium with RASS +1 or higher
    - Hypoactive delirium: Delirium with RASS 0 or lower
1. **Normal**: RASS missing or >= -3, and CAM Negative

If the patient's RASS was -3 or higher, but the CAM was marked Unable to Assess,
this information was marked as conflicting and the assessment was considered to
be missing.

Patients could have multiple assessments on a given study day. On a given *day*, a patient was considered delirious if any assessment was considered delirious; comatose if no assessments met criteria for delirium and at least one was considered comatose; and normal if no assessments met criteria for delirium or coma, and at least one was considered normal.

### Handling Missing Data

Despite the best efforts of our coordinators, we had a small amount of missing
data on the assessment and daily level. The following table describes the amount
of missingness by assessment and by day, for both all in-hospital days
*(pre-randomization, intervention, post-intervention, among all consented
patients)* and all in-hospital days during the intervention period among
randomized patients only *(the period during which all our mental status
outcomes are calculated)*.

Mental status can change quickly; therefore simple imputation methods like last observation carried forward could be inaccurate. Since we are fortunate to have strong covariate data, we performed single imputation to impute individual missing RASS and CAM scores, including the following variables as covariates in
the imputation. We used predictive mean matching and polytomous logistic
regression as the imputation methods, respectively, within R's `mice` package.

- **Baseline**: Age at consent; gender; BMI; education; level of proficiency in English; insurance; home antipsychotic use; Charlson comorbidities index; CSHA Clinical Frailty Score; APACHE II APS
- **Daily**:
    - Medications (clonazepam, dexmedetomidine, propofol, remifentanil, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, opioids [IV and PO], antibiotics, anxiolytics, statins)
    - Variables indicating severity of illness (CV SOFA, creatinine, urine output, platelets, lowest recorded RASS, Glasgow Coma Scale, P/F ratio, S/F ratio, bilirubin)
    - Any mental status data available the day of, the day before, and the day after the missing day
    
After any missing RASS and CAM values were imputed, we then determined all mental statuses (whether patients were comatose, delirious, hyperactively delirious, and hypoactively delirious) based on these imputed values and the
algorithm noted above.

All summary variables (delirium/coma-free days, delirium duration, and coma duration) are presented using imputed mental status.

`r devtools::session_info()$platform$version` was used for all analyses. `r table_nums('package_info', display = 'cite')`, collapsed below, shows all add-on
packages loaded.

We also used R for all data management. Links to all R code for both data
management and this analysis can be found on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/mq38r/).

We use the [`checkpoint`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkpoint) package
for **reproducibility**. This package downloaded R package versions on CRAN as
of May 14, 2018, and will use these versions going forward, regardless of future
software updates. (The `ggthemr` and `JTHelpers` packages, solely housed on
Github, were also installed in this directory on the same date.)
